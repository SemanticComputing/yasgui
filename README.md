IMPORTANT
======
This is the old (but relatively stable) YASGUI repository, which is not supported anymore.

The new collection of YASGUI-related libraries is accessible at [http://github.com/YASGUI][3].
This collection currently contains [YASQE][4] (a JS SPARQL editor), and [YASR][5] (a JS SPARQL resultset visualizer).
In the (distant!) future, I'll publish a client-side version of YASGUI, which combines YASQE and YASR. Though, if anyone would like to pick this up, feel free ;)
